## Overview of the analysis:

In this module, we work on UFO sightings data and created a webpage and dynamic table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using  JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website. 

Following data was used for the UFO sighting analysis:

### Purpose of analysis:
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript "Standard" and JavaScript Version ES6+.
- Describes JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- Create and implement JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Converts JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Create and expand ForEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Dynamically create, populate, and filter tables using JavaScript and HTML

### Coding tools:
- **JavaScript is used as the primary coding language:**
JavaScript is an established programming language designed to extend HTML. It is the backbone of many popular visualization libraries such as Plotly and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also offers advanced customization.

- **HTML:**
HTML is a standardized text file tagging system that creates the structure of almost every page you find and use on the web. HTML that adds page breaks, paragraphs, bold, italics, etc. HTML builds this structure using tags that tell the browser how to handle the text.

## Results: 

UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy? website showcases UFO sighting data in US. Website provides various criterias to filter the data and gather the required information. The data is filtered based on the "Date", "City", "State", "Country" and "Shape". In order to use the filter the user has to enter the value in the filter colomn and press "Enter", the table will auto populate the filtered output.

## Summary: 

### Drawback of the website:

Website is of great use to user who is interested in looking for a particular data of UFO sighting in the month of January in 2010 but if user is looking for data of a different year or different month then the website do not produce any output as the data set is only limited to the month of January in 2010. 

### Recommendation for further development:

- Website data need to be more diverse: The website data need to be more detailed to provide all the information about UFO sightings for multiple years and all the months of the year. So that user can make analysis based on this data.

- Website needs more visuals: The data of sightings could be supported by the images of the respected sightings to give it more visuals and a future reference of what to look for in case of a sighting.
