## Overview of the analysis:

In this module, we work on UFO sightings data and created a webpage and dynamic table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using  JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

### Purpose of analysis:
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of JavaScript "Standard" and JavaScript Version ES6+.
- Describes JavaScript syntax and ideal use cases.
- Create and implement JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.
- Converts JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
- Create and expand ForEach (JavaScript for loop).
- Dynamically create, populate, and filter tables using JavaScript and HTML

### Coding tools:
- **JavaScript is used as the primary coding language:**
