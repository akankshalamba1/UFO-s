## Overview of the analysis:

In this module, we work on UFO sightings data and created a webpage and dynamic table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary: 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
